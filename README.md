### Hi thereðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Jacky, but you can also call me Jordles. Im a software developer with a focus on full-stack development.

I'm currently taking a bootcamp by 100Devs, while practicing code everyday on LeetCode & CodeWars, among other helpful resources online. You can also check out my LinkedIn and my other socials through my personal portfolio!
